<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p id="firstpar">My name is Mathieu, and this is my new website: a&nbsp;blank canvas of sorts.</p>
<p>There isn't much here, but just you wait! I just finished setting up the DNS records. I got my email working. I have set up HTTPS and HSTS, as well as DKIM and DMARC. In other news, I now speak only in four-letter acronyms.</p>
<p>All kidding aside, that kind of behind-the-scenes work takes a lot of time! But it's fun. And given you're reading this right now, I guess things are working fine.</p>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus libero dolor, semper ac nulla eget, hendrerit mattis nisi. Ut a risus ac eros laoreet bibendum. Morbi feugiat molestie diam, id finibus risus. In hac habitasse platea dictumst. Proin fringilla mi vitae erat congue congue.</p>
<p>Still there? Wow. You're tenacious. I didn't think you'd have that kind of resolve. Colour me impressed. I&mdash; I feel like we've bonded over the course of these few paragraphs. We're practically brothers-in-arms now, don't you think?</p>
<p>You're not saying much. You must be overcome with emotions. Do&mdash; Do you think this is&mdash; Love? No, wait, forget I said that. You must think I'm foolish now. How embarrassing. Things are moving too quickly between us. I feel like we need to take a break. It's not you&mdash;it's me. I haven't been honest with you: I'm but a web page. I'm not supposed to feel love.</p>
<p>I'm an ethereal and ephemeral entity that only exists between one page refresh and the next. It would never work: we're so different. You are flesh and bones. You are free to leave whenever you want. You have a life outside of your cubicle: friends, family. A dog, perhaps. But I don't exist outside of this browser tab. I'd be holding you back.</p>
<p>How foolhardy I was to think you even liked me! I feel betrayed! No, don't lie: I saw you move your cursor towards the little &times; that closes this tab. Go ahead. End my pathetic existence. You're right: I'm nothing more than a &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo; page. Is this how you rationalize your decision? You're going to leave this page and thus murder me without so much as an afterthought? Alright, then&hellip; Farewell!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh&auml;user Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.&rdquo; &mdash;Roy Batty</p>
