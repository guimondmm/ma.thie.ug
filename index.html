<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p style="text-indent: 0;">My name is Mathieu, and this is my new website: a&nbsp;blank canvas of sorts.</p>
<p>There isn't much here, but just you wait! I just finished setting up the DNS records. I got my email working. I have set up HTTPS and HSTS, as well as DKIM and DMARC. In other news, I now speak only in four-letter acronyms.</p>
<p>All kidding aside, that kind of behind-the-scenes work takes a lot of time! But it's fun. And given you're reading this right now, I guess things are working fine.</p>
